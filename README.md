# AutoTag

##Overview:
A project to automatically tag certain loans on Kiva.org.
Licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. 
Project currently in development, with almost everything still in the testing phase. 
For testing, the project currently uses the csv of assigned loans from Kivatools.org. Currently this is not public and cannot be uploaded,
to Github because of non-ASKI characters, soplease contact me at thomas d0t woodside At gmail d0t com if you would like the data. 
All of the testing and implementation are done in Python 3.5, with some development done in R. 


##Requirements:
All systems must be 99% accurate. This is tested using the assigned loans list at least 30 days after the system was last modified.
Pull requests on existing systems will be accepted if they pass this test and identify a larger percentage of loans than the current system.
