# AutoTag

##Overview:
A project to automatically tag certain loans on Kiva.org.
Licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. 
Project currently in development, with almost everything still in the testing phase. 
For testing, the project currently uses the csv of assigned loans from Kivatools.org. This cannot be uploaded to Github because it contains non-ASKI characters, but you can download it at http://kivatools.com/downloads. 
All of the testing and implementation are done in Python 3.5, with some development done in R. 


##Requirements:
All systems must be 99% accurate. This is tested using the assigned loans list using a list of loans the earliest of which was posted later than the latest-posted loan used for testing.
Pull requests on existing systems will be accepted if they pass this test and identify a larger percentage of loans than any current systems.
