This is their evening meal along with some leftover bits of cooked sadza that the family ate. At the end of the day she puts them in a cage for security reasons, so that they would not be attacked by wild cats or stray dogs that prowl around the neighbourhood at night. During the day they spend their time scratching and pecking the bare soil looking for small creatures to eat. Occasionally they are fed grains, cut vegetables and are given drinking water in a small basin. The free range chickens are easy to manage and feed; they do not have any special diet. They have a longer life span than the broiler chicken, hence costing more when being sold. <br /><br />Magna, chairlady of Eversharp Group, is into poultry rearing. She keeps two types of chickens, the broilers and the roadrunners. She keeps the broilers in well maintained fowl runs in her home, as they need to be securely kept and well looked after because they are very sensitive.

1014768,"The evolution of women empowerment has led to equal job opportunities for both men and women. Nowadays there is no segregation despite ones’ sexuality, since jobs or trades are no longer recognized on the basis of gender. Females now go for other trades which were previously recognized as ‘manly’. 

Nyengeterai and Esther are among those women who have ventured in such businesses; they are into selling scrap materials. The duo started this business in 2014 at a smaller scale, doing it behind someone’s name up until they got their own clients. They supply to clients almost every week or fortnight, depending the demand at hand.
 
Nyengeterai, aged 41, is a member of Sungano group, which is based in Budiriro, a high density area in Harare. The Sungano group is currently left with three members who are now applying for their fifth loan from Thrive. They have been able to pay Thrive loans well without any default problems, and Nyengeterai played a vital, influential leadership role for the success of the group. 

In her first and second loans, she was in cross border trading, specializing in clothes and shoes that she was procuring from Botswana and South Africa. The market became flooded such that it was unprofitable for her to continue in that trade. She took a risk by venturing into the scrap metal business, but luckily the risk was worth it. She is still a cross border who procures scrap metal locally and sells it in Botswana. As a business person, she, on her return from her trips, brings cash, clothing and furniture upon orders.

Being a single mother with only one dependent, she has managed to purchase a residential stand and changed most of her household property, including a television set, four-plate stove, and sofas from her profits in those previous loans. 

As a group, they are applying for $2,650 from Thrive, and Nyengeterai wants to restock more scrap material because she is failing to meet the demand needs of the market.

She learned the trade from her parents and now she honors them by continuing it. She farms a small plot of land in the green, lush hills of Maili nane, Kitale, which is in the Rift valley region of Kenya. Lisper is happily married and is blessed with a lovely family. 

For the past 10 years, she has been involved in mixed farming. She grows maize and vegetables, and she also keeps dairy cows and goats. Lisper has been able to provide nutritious food for her family. She earns profits selling a variety of food crops, but she is faced with the challenge of delivering the produce in a timely manner to the market. This challenge has not made her give up and she states ""I have to do something for my three children."" 

Lisper joined Juhudi Kilimo, which is a microfinance institution that assists aspiring women like her. She requests a loan from Juhudi Kilimo via Kiva lenders to buy a motorbike. Lisper is from a remote village that has poor roads and transporting her produce to the market has been a challenge. She has suffered many losses of perishable products (milk, vegetables and tomatoes) which require timely delivery to the market. This loan will help Lisper to achieve her dream and reach her goals. 

For smallholder women in Kenya, accessing a financial solution is tough, but Lisper feels relieved to know that there are institutions such as Juhudi Kilimo and Kiva that help women. The benefits of this loan are many and one of them is that Lisper will never suffer losses due to delay in delivering produce to the market. She will increase her sales volume because she will be able to transport more goods to the market. As a result, her income will increase. 

Lisper intends to employ someone to ride the motorbike and help with farm work. Lisper will use the loan to improve her living conditions and assure her children of a secure future. You can help Lisper with the loan she needs and get her closer to accomplishing her dreams.

The primary goal of every woman is to see her children educated!<br /><br />The very hardworking and determined 47 year old Blanca is a member of “Estrellas de San Antonio”.  Growing up, she never was able to attend school and like most rural Maya girls was married at a very early age and began to have babies - 17 pregnancies.  But, because her village was very remote, there were no health services to help her with any difficulties she might have.  As a result, only 8 of her children survived.  It is for these 8 children that she works hard at her small but profitable business raising and selling live chickens, as well as selling chicken meat.  Blanca is requesting a loan to buy more chickens to raise as well as food to feed and fatten her birds.<br />Blanca says that thanks to her own determination, the microcredit loans as well as the educational trainings, she has been able to grow her business enough to have income to send 6 of her children through high school. The youngest two are in the first and fifth grades.  She will continue to strive to successfully maintain her business so that her children can continue to develop academically. <br /><br />Blanca and the other members of “Estrellas de San Antonio” benefit from their participation in the Trust Bank in two ways.  Besides receiving the microcredit loans, they also receive  non-formal education trainings. They acquire business skills as well as health and hygiene. The women learn about medicinal plants that help them on a daily basis.  They also learn about self-esteem, overcoming domestic violence, and becoming an empowered woman.  <br /><br />Kiva investors are an integral part of their development both personally and financially.  Thank you to each of you! You are much appreciated!",1

They live in Patulul, a town that is located in the warm tropical southwest region of Guatemala where many different kinds of fruits grow along with coconuts.  It is also a region that is marked by acres of coffee plantations.  Many a coffee lover likes Guatemala coffee.    <br /><br />Susana is a member of “Rosa de Guadalupe”.  She is 27 years old and has two children.  Like so many Maya women, Susana was not able to go to school beyond the third grade because her parents could not afford to send her to school.  She needed to stay home to help her parents.  In Guatemala, parents are obligated to pay for their children’s school supplies which can be extremely costly when there is not enough income to feed the family.  When a child reaches middle school, the parents have to pay half of the school’s tuition and then for high school they have to pay full tuition.  This can hamper any child’s education if the parents do not have a thriving businesses.<br /><br />The lack of an ongoing formal education did not slow down the dynamic Susana who is a self-starter with goals of success for her small business selling milk products, perfumes, lotions and facial creams.  Because her goal is to improve her bottom line, she is requesting a loan to increase her inventory of perfumes and milk.  Susana feels that if she can increase her profits from the loan, she can then provide for a better education for her children. <br /><br />Susana and the other members of the Trust Bank “Rosa de Guadalupe” are very grateful to KIVA investors who have such generous hearts to give much needed support to them and other Maya women in Guatemala.
