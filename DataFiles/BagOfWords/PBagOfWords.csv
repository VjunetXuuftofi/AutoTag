Nowadays there is no segregation despite ones’ sexuality, since jobs or trades are no longer recognized on the basis of gender. Females now go for other trades which were previously recognized as ‘manly’. 

Nyengeterai and Esther are among those women who have ventured in such businesses; they are into selling scrap materials. The duo started this business in 2014 at a smaller scale, doing it behind someone’s name up until they got their own clients. They supply to clients almost every week or fortnight, depending the demand at hand.
 
Nyengeterai, aged 41, is a member of Sungano group, which is based in Budiriro, a high density area in Harare. The Sungano group is currently left with three members who are now applying for their fifth loan from Thrive. They have been able to pay Thrive loans well without any default problems, and Nyengeterai played a vital, influential leadership role for the success of the group. 

In her first and second loans, she was in cross border trading, specializing in clothes and shoes that she was procuring from Botswana and South Africa. The market became flooded such that it was unprofitable for her to continue in that trade. She took a risk by venturing into the scrap metal business, but luckily the risk was worth it. She is still a cross border who procures scrap metal locally and sells it in Botswana. As a business person, she, on her return from her trips, brings cash, clothing and furniture upon orders.

Being a single mother with only one dependent, she has managed to purchase a residential stand and changed most of her household property, including a television set, four-plate stove, and sofas from her profits in those previous loans. 

As a group, they are applying for $2,650 from Thrive, and Nyengeterai wants to restock more scrap material because she is failing to meet the demand needs of the market.

She has been farming for the past five years. She has gained so much experience through these years of farming. Priscilla practices mixed farming; that is, she grows maize and also keeps dairy cows. Through these activities she has been able to earn a decent and honest income. Because of the passion she has for farming, she has even nicknamed one of her cows. She really enjoys taking care of her cows. <br /><br />Although Priscilla has been making profits through farming, not everything has been easy for this humble and industrious mum. Her farm has not been producing as much of a harvest lately because of the lack of fertilizer and good seeds, and the presence of pests and diseases. That is why she is seeking a loan to buy farm inputs and seeds, so as to expand her horticulture farm. Through the loan, Priscilla will be assured of a bumper harvest and this will translate into more profits and cash. Through the use of good seeds and fertilizer, she will increase her profit margins. <br /><br />Using this loan, Priscilla will be able to expand her horticulture business. She sees a lot of room for improvement and growth. What is lacking is the capital to drive the positive change. With your loan, Priscilla will make enough income to take care of her family and meet other farming expenses. She wakes up early and goes to sleep very late every day to give her family a decent living and her children a proper education. You can help Priscilla with this dream through a loan that would mean a lot to her and her family. Her dream is to have a large horticulture farm, to live comfortably and be very happy with her four children.",1

He is reliable, balanced, and has a good attitude. He carries out his business in the “Villa Copacabana” zone located on the eastern slope of the city, where the streets are steep. 

He is of dark complexion. He has brown, really sad, distant and uncertain eyes. Poetry is born in his mother tongue, Aymará, which he only shares with his family and relatives. His life was driven by the birth of his son who studies at school. Juan and his partner guide and care from him with a lot of love. They live in a rented room made of brick and they have access to running water, electricity and sewage. 

His business is the sale of fast food in two daily shifts. In the mornings until noon, it is traditional food – 'salteñas' [Bolivian baked empanadas] or 'tucumanas' which are a mix of meat and vegetables baked or fried.  From 5pm, the favorite foods are hamburgers and salchipapas. The latter is composed of pieces of sausages coupled with potatoes; everything is fried. He carries out this activity in his sales stand close to a very crowded square.  He comments, “I learned the business from my dad who makes a living doing the same work. When my family grew, I had to launch my own business.”

His business is successful because he works very hard together with his partner. The advantage of his business is that he counts on daily sales and customers. The disadvantage is the lack of an industrial oven to expand the menu and sell baked chicken.  

His dream is to grow his business to generate better income and improve the quality of life of his family. He wishes to purchase an industrial oven and tools such as scissors to cut chicken, knives and others. This is his first loan cycle with the institution in the 2 years that he has done this work. 

For these reasons, Juan is requesting a loan to purchase an industrial oven to expand the menu and sell baked chicken.

1004691,"Thomas, 32, is a smallholder farmer residing in Nyamira, an agricultural town in the south Rift region of Kenya. He is arguably the most successful client of Juhudi Kilimo, a microfinance institution that deals only with smallholder farmers in rural parts of Kenya.

Back in 2009, Thomas practiced traditional farming with little knowledge and no financing at all. He was doing only half an acre crop of maize per season. The returns were so meager that he could barely survive. He kept doing maize farming for years without turning a profit until 2013, when he switched to tomato farming and there was light at the end of the tunnel for Thomas. 

Today, Thomas is a fully-fledged entrepreneur. He has been provided with technical guidance, training programs, and exposure visits. He has already serviced other asset-based loans fully from Juhudi Kilimo! Through the loans, he has acquired numerous farm supplies.

To capitalize more on returns from the booming tomato farming, Thomas is seeking a loan of KES 70,000 to build a greenhouse. Unlike his competition, Thomas uses modern farming techniques to ensure high quality produce. By doing this, he has created a name for himself and a demand for his produce. 

Your lending will contribute greatly to the actualization of Thomas' goal, which is to expand the greenhouse. In the future he is planning to start exporting his produce to international markets. Be inspired and make a loan!

Her clients know her because she visits and is present at all the markets in the area. ""My sale season lasts the whole year because here the climate is cold"" she says.

The advantage of his business is that it relies on extensive experience, and the disadvantage is the lack of tools for repairs. His dream is to have an extensive and complete store. He wishes to purchase tools for the repair of computers. This is his second loan cycle with the institution in the 4 years he has done this work.

For these reasons, Christian is requesting a loan to buy tools for the repair and maintenance of computers.

1004158,"Jose is a typical farmer born on the land that he inherited from his parents. At age 63 he still is as happy as a child to be on his land, those fields that have given him so much and to which he has dedicated the best years of his life. 

He is a married man without children, therefore the farming responsibility rests entirely on his shoulders. Even at his considerable age, he is happy doing the work he's done practically all his life.

Jose is applying for this loan to buy the quantity of fertilizers needed for his fields. The loan amount will be sufficient, and the reason for this amount is the high cost of these agricultural products on the market.

Her business succeeds because the price of the food is accessible to everyone.

He is consistent, responsible, and hardworking. 

His business is located in the 'Max Paredes' district, characterized as being one of the oldest and most popular shopping areas. Here, clothes are made next to restaurants, and schools, and businesses of all types. The weather is cold and dry with a maximum temperature of 14 degrees Celsius.

Ever is swarthy, with short black hair and a sturdy build. His mother tongue is Aymara, which he speaks within his family. He speaks Spanish in situations of general culture and in his business.

His business is selling and installing satellite dishes. The long distances and difficult access to remote towns makes television a nonexistent service.
