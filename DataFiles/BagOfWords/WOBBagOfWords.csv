At the end of the day she puts them in a cage for security reasons, so that they would not be attacked by wild cats or stray dogs that prowl around the neighbourhood at night. During the day they spend their time scratching and pecking the bare soil looking for small creatures to eat.

She keeps two types of chickens, the broilers and the roadrunners.

1014768,"The evolution of women empowerment has led to equal job opportunities for both men and women. Nowadays there is no segregation despite ones’ sexuality, since jobs or trades are no longer recognized on the basis of gender. Females now go for other trades which were previously recognized as ‘manly’. 

Nyengeterai and Esther are among those women who have ventured in such businesses; they are into selling scrap materials. The duo started this business in 2014 at a smaller scale, doing it behind someone’s name up until they got their own clients. They supply to clients almost every week or fortnight, depending the demand at hand.
 
Nyengeterai, aged 41, is a member of Sungano group, which is based in Budiriro, a high density area in Harare. The Sungano group is currently left with three members who are now applying for their fifth loan from Thrive. They have been able to pay Thrive loans well without any default problems, and Nyengeterai played a vital, influential leadership role for the success of the group. 

In her first and second loans, she was in cross border trading, specializing in clothes and shoes that she was procuring from Botswana and South Africa. The market became flooded such that it was unprofitable for her to continue in that trade. She took a risk by venturing into the scrap metal business, but luckily the risk was worth it. She is still a cross border who procures scrap metal locally and sells it in Botswana. As a business person, she, on her return from her trips, brings cash, clothing and furniture upon orders.

Being a single mother with only one dependent, she has managed to purchase a residential stand and changed most of her household property, including a television set, four-plate stove, and sofas from her profits in those previous loans. 

As a group, they are applying for $2,650 from Thrive, and Nyengeterai wants to restock more scrap material because she is failing to meet the demand needs of the market.

Monicah passionately loves poultry farming, but the biggest challenge she faces is a lack of capital to buy quality breeds of poultry that are resistant to diseases and lay more eggs. <br /><br />Monicah is seeking a loan to purchase additional poultry. She will use her excess maize to feed the poultry and will provide sorghum to give the poultry energy and green grams (beans) for protein. Through better feeding, the poultry will increase their egg production and will lay more eggs that are of good quality, which will translate to more income. Apart from an increase in egg production, she will get increased output from poultry meat, and this will further increase her income and profit margins. Through increased profits, she intends to turn around her living conditions and live a better life. <br /><br />In addition to profits, Monicah will benefit from chicken manure, which contains the highest amount of nitrogen of any livestock manure and is very valuable as fertilizer.

Back in 2009, Thomas practiced traditional farming with little knowledge and no financing at all. He was doing only half an acre crop of maize per season.

He kept doing maize farming for years without turning a profit until 2013, when he switched to tomato farming and there was light at the end of the tunnel for Thomas. 

Today, Thomas is a fully-fledged entrepreneur. He has been provided with technical guidance, training programs, and exposure visits. He has already serviced other asset-based loans fully from Juhudi Kilimo! Through the loans, he has acquired numerous farm supplies.

To capitalize more on returns from the booming tomato farming, Thomas is seeking a loan of KES 70,000 to build a greenhouse. Unlike his competition, Thomas uses modern farming techniques to ensure high quality produce. By doing this, he has created a name for himself and a demand for his produce.

Jonah is a smallholder farmer in the Kinoru, Nkubu area of Kenya. <br /><br />In the past ten years, he has bred more than one dairy cow and has developed his farm. Jonah was unable to study to attain a professional career, because of the economic situation that his family faced. However, he has never given up and has been skillfully practicing farming. Because of how much he likes farming, he has even nicknamed one of his cows. He is a very proud farmer, especially when he is milking his cows. Through his dairy cow, he is able to get 5-10 liters a day, and this helps him support his family. He also keeps goats and has a side hustle business (motorbike). <br /><br />Jonah also practices crop farming, but he has not been making good profits because of poor farming implements. This is why he is kindly seeking a loan to buy farm implements. Through the loan, he will be able to buy high-quality seeds, good fertilizer, and pesticides that he will use to greatly improve his crop production. Modern farming requires the use of modern techniques; using high-quality seeds will assure him of a bumper harvest and hence, increased profit levels. <br /><br />Jonah is visionary, and his goal for the season is to boost his crop production and be able to get more crop output than the previous year.

She needed to stay home to help her parents.  In Guatemala, parents are obligated to pay for their children’s school supplies which can be extremely costly when there is not enough income to feed the family.  When a child reaches middle school, the parents have to pay half of the school’s tuition and then for high school they have to pay full tuition.  This can hamper any child’s education if the parents do not have a thriving businesses.<br /><br />The lack of an ongoing formal education did not slow down the dynamic Susana who is a self-starter with goals of success for her small business selling milk products, perfumes, lotions and facial creams.  Because her goal is to improve her bottom line, she is requesting a loan to increase her inventory of perfumes and milk.  Susana feels that if she can increase her profits from the loan, she can then provide for a better education for her children. <br /><br />Susana and the other members of the Trust Bank “Rosa de Guadalupe” are very grateful to KIVA investors who have such generous hearts to give much needed support to them and other Maya women in Guatemala.  Thank you and cheers for much success in 2016!",1

Araceli is part of this group.   She is known for being a hardworking woman who is always concerned about her family's well-being.  Motivated by her Uncle Tio and her husband Ismael, she decided to start up a business raising pigs in her community.  ""My uncle has a lot of experience in this business, and he told us that this would be a very good option because the animals grow rapidly and the earnings are good,"" she says.

In order to ensure the optimal growth of her animals, she gives them special care from the time they are very young, because this is the key stage in the growth process.  At this time, she is taking a loan to buy food for the 23 animals who she is keeping in her pig shed.  She will also use the funds to buy sheets of steel roofing material to cover the shed and to separate the areas between the small and larger pigs.  

Araceli's main customers are the local meat stores, and also people who are planning festivities such as weddings, birthdays, baptisms, 15-year birthday celebrations, and other events.  Araceli is very grateful to the institution, because thanks to these loans she has a stable business that is generating a sustainable stream of income.  Thanks to her earnings, she has been able to pay for some general expenses as well as cover her personal expenses.  Her goal is for her children to complete their educations and study for a university degree.  

The other members of this group are: Jose Luciano and Alberto, who will invest in cattle, Valentina and Cecilia, who will also invest in cattle, and Don Miguel, who will invest in pigs.  

Note: this photo was taken in the spot on Araceli's farm where she keeps her pigs.  Araceli is the one wearing boots.

Because of its altitude, it can be quite cool compared with other parts of the country.  Most of the population exists at a subsistence level.  Santa Maria de Jesus is one of the communities that makes up the greater Zunil.  <br /><br />Fourteen industrious and dedicated women, who formed the Friendship Bridge Trust Bank “Santa Maria”, are preparing to ask for their third loan from Kiva lenders.  Their previous loans have been paid on time and in full.  These earlier loans helped increase the revenue of their small businesses and helped the ladies to pay for much needed supplies for their businesses like flour for bread, masa for tortillas, fruit, vegetables, chicken and meat.<br /><br />The President of “Santa Maria” is 32 year old Romelia who is married and has 4 children.  Romelia’s small convenience store has been growing little by little over the past loan cycles.  She sells many items that are needed on a daily basis, including many different kinds of fruits that are very popular with her customers.  Romelia wants to expand her inventory, and is asking for a loan to buy rice, sugar, oil, eggs, oats, coffee, beans, juices, soda and seasonal fruit.  It is important for her to have a larger inventory at this time of year because the holidays are coming which means her customers are wanting more items for their holiday preparations. <br /><br />Romelia is very happy to report that with the income from her small business along with her husband’s income, she is able to provide her four children, ages 4-12, with the ability to go to school.  Being able to provide an education for their children is very important for the women of Guatemala.  Most of them have barely finished the second grade because it has been the tradition for young girls to only help around the house to learn how to become good housewives which usually begins at the age of 14.  An education for them is considered unimportant.<br /><br />The women of the Trust Bank “Santa Maria” send KIVA investors Best Wishes for a Happy Holiday Season. They are deeply appreciative and look forward to a more prosperous 2016 with the help of Kiva lenders!!!",1
